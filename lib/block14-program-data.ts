FASE：暗号資産、ステーブルコイン、トークン化預金の調和\n暗号資産に関連するエコシステムの産業構造やビジネス構造に関する標準的なモデルが定義されていないことで、日本の新しい規制の枠組みにおいて暗号資産エコシステムが健全に持続的に維持できるかどうかが見通せなくなっています。このセッションでは、日本の有識者によるたたき台となるディスカッションペーパーに基づき、暗号資産に関わるエコシステムの産業構造に関する現状とあるべき姿を取りまとめる予定です。\n\n2. ブロックチェーン技術コンペティション（経産省セッション）\n経済産業省により、ブロックチェーン技術を対象としたコンペティションのアナウンスと運営方針の議論が行われます。PQC（耐量子暗号）移行と高度な鍵管理をテーマとした技術コンペティション（NISTの暗号標準化コンペティションに類似）の概要と、コンペティションの運営ガイドラインについての議論が予定されています。",
